## Designated Driver (DD) Roulette

### Background
Blockchain token system used to determine who will be designated driver among a group of friends when they go out

### Motivation 
To have a system in place for everyone to get home safely without one person always getting stuck being the DD, or the person who is supposed to be DD backing out and stranding everyone

### Questions to answer
* What is the consequence for not fulfilling your obligation if you are chosen as the DD
* Who will be included in your group
* What will be the incentive to participate
* Is this an ongoing system or one contract per event
